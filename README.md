Write a colab to demonstrate various dimensionality reduction techniques discussed in the class (and some not discussed)

Provide a detailed video going thru wqlkthru of yiur colab code

a) any image data set (i gave examples of faces and digits data sets colabs in slides in links / notes)

b) any tabular data set (i gave example of iris data set in slides with colab links)

You need to showcase
- LLE

- t-SNE - interactive visualization

- ISOMAP

- UMAP - interactive visual.ization

- MDS

- Randomized PCA

- Kernel PCA

- Incremental PCA 

- Factor analysis (scikit learn)

- autoencoders
Provide your proper commentary of results of what you think the results are and how these techniques compare wtih each other in the submission read.me and colab.

Try to use as many distinct datasets as possible (do not use the same data sets) - try to use medical data sets from good papers.

You need to submit the github directory link for the assignment

Any good visualization tools usage in colab will be appreciated as well to do interactive display like https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/ Links to an external site.paper tools.
b) Demonstrate dimensionality reduction using data bricks
